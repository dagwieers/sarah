DOWNLOADING ERRATA
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Sarah currently requires a stuffed directory of advisories from RHN as XML files.

You can download these files automatically by using the aerrate.py script from
Tim Rupp. Available from:

	cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cdcvs.fnal.gov:/cvs/scientificlinux co aerrate

And issuing the following script:

	cd aerrate
	for release in rh{21,el3,el4}as rh{21,el3,el4}es rh{21,el3,el4}ws rhel3{cluster,devsuite} rhel{3,4}-extras rh-desktop-{3,4} rh21aw rhshas; do
		./aerrate.py --source=site --type=security --release=$release
	done
	cd -

This will copy all errata as XML files into ./advisories/


USING SARAH
^^^^^^^^^^^
sarah currently expects the advisories to be available from ./advisories/ as well. So making
a symlink from aerrate.advisories to sarah/advisories is probably easiest.

	ln -sf aerrate/advisories .

Then to create an sqlite database out of these XML files, run:

	./sarahdb.py

You should now have a sarahdb.sqlite file in your current directory.
To create some statistics from this database, use:

	./sarahprint.py

The sarahprint utility currently shows how to query the database(s). Not all information
is currently available from the XML files or from RHN. Help is welcome.


PROXY PROBLEMS ?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you're behind a proxy that only allows SSL Proxy access (CONNECT method) for HTTPS sites,
you're currently out of luck. The urllib2 implementation of python only has the HTTPS GET
method implemented. More information at:
