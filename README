DOWNLOADING ERRATA
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Sarah currently requires a stuffed directory of advisories from RHN as XML files.

You can download these files automatically by using the aerrate.py script from
Tim Rupp. Available from:

	svn co http://caphrim.net/svn/fermi/aerrate/trunk aerrate

Then apply the latest patch from patches/:

	patch -p0 < patches/aerrate-changes-dag-TIMESTAMP.diff

And issue the following command to scrape the RHN website for the most up-to-date
advisories:

	cd aerrate
	./aerrate.py -r --source=site --type=all --release=enterprise
	cd -

This will copy all errata as XML files into ./aerrata/advisories/

USING SARAH
^^^^^^^^^^^
sarah currently expects the advisories to be available from ./advisories/. So
making a symlink from aerrate/advisories to ./advisories is probably easiest.

	ln -sf aerrate/advisories .

Then create an sqlite database out of these XML files, by doing:

	./sarahdb.py

You should now have a sarahdb.sqlite file in your current directory.
To create some statistics from this database, use:

	./sarahinfo.py

The sarahinfo utility currently shows how to query the database. Not all
information is currently available in the XML files. Red Hat will be releasing
these XML files in the future with more information we can get out of the 
RHN website.

I also added sarahsql to allow to query the database on the commandline, you
can do queries in bash, like:

        ### Print filenames related to advisory
        ./sarahsql.py 'select distinct filename from rpm where advid == "RHSA-2005:039" order by filename'

        ### Show last 10 updated advisories
        ./sarahsql.py 'select advid, issued, updated, severity, synopsis from adv order by updated' | tail

	### Show last 10 updated security advisories
	./sarahsql.py 'select advid, issued, updated, severity, synopsis from adv where type == "RHSA" order by updated' | tail

	### Show last 10 updates security advisories for 4AS
	./sarahsql.py 'select distinct adv.advid,updated,severity,synopsis from adv,rpm where adv.advid == rpm.advid and type == "RHSA" and prodshort == "4AS" order by updated' | tail

	### Show all files related to 3AS order by issue date
	./sarahsql.py 'select issued,filename from rpm,adv where adv.advid == rpm.advid and prodshort == "3AS" and arch == "i386" order by issued'

Help is welcome to extend sarah much further. The TODO file is the first stop
for interesting parties.


PROXY PROBLEMS ?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you're behind a proxy that only allows SSL Proxy access (CONNECT method) for
HTTPS sites, you're currently out of luck. The urllib2 implementation of python
only has the HTTPS GET method implemented. More information at:
